Create a folder for backend
In cmd type " npm init " : for package.json
In cmd type " npm i express " for node modules
Create a index.js file
    import express inside index.js
    using express create an app
    setup port number
    use json parser for server application

        then run index.js using code " nodoemon index.js " in cmd

To connect backend to frontend 
    install cors - " npm i cors "
    import cors
    using cors specify origin to the server - (ie, specify the frontend origin. this step is known as integration)
    get api - here for ecommerce app search in web fakestoreapi/products
    create db.json file and copy paste all the data from api in it
    create a dataBase using mongoDb, then import all the data from db.json
    install mongoose to establish connection between server and mongoDb dataBase - " npm i mongoose " 
    create a folder called services, inside this create 2 files dataService.js and db.js
        In db.js - import mongoose to establish connection between server and mongoDb dataBase
        Define connection string - (copy code from mongoDb compass and add the dataBase name at the end of string)
        inside db.js create model to store all products as the same name as collection inside mongodb, but make first letter in caps
        resolve API requests in index.js

Connection flow - (mongoDb to db.js, db.js to dataService.js, dataService to index.js) ie; mongoDb to
